	Quick hummus recipe This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years. 	
	Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.

	<em>Hummus </em>, that creamy dip that hails from the Middle East, has a reputation as a clean, healthy food. It deserves it.
	All the main ingredients are super foods in their own right. 
	It's got chickpeas, sesame paste (tahini), garlic, and olive oil in most traditional versions.
